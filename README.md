# LoanX

LoanX is a student loan payment calculator developed with Python that also creates an amortization schedule to help borrowers see monthly payment breakdowns. Designed on Google Colab, the tool implements a dynamic table with Pythonâ€™s NumPy and Pandas libraries to visualize the schedule data. 

Borrowers can also explore how to reach their debt-free goals quicker! LoanX offers an overview of the duration of years and months it will take to pay off a loan. Borrowers can simply increase their monthly payment amount input to see faster loan repayment outcomes.
