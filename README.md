# LoanX Calculator

LoanX is a student loan payment calculator developed with Python that also creates an amortization schedule to help borrowers see monthly payment breakdowns. Designed using the Flask web framework and jQuery, the calculator web application implements a dynamic table with Pythonâ€™s NumPy and Pandas libraries to visualize the schedule data. 

Borrowers can also explore how to reach their debt-free goals quicker! Through its "Explore" feature, LoanX offers an overview of the duration of years and months it will take to pay off a loan when increasing the monthly payment amount. Borrowers can simply add an additional payment to see faster loan repayment outcomes.
